# Shaders-Modern

A repository with shader settings for the TerraFirmaCraft mod and in particular for the TerraFirmaGreg modpack, but you can still use it separately from the modpack.

Feel free to create a PR to add other shaders to this list.

## How to use

1. Download complementary shaders zipfile from https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/.
1. Unzip into `.minecraft/shaderpacks` directory, creating a subdirectory named
   e.g. `ComplementaryUnbound_r5.2.2`.
1. Replace `shaders/block.properties` in this directory with either
   `ComplementaryShaders/block.properties` for Complementary v4.x, or
   `ComplementaryShaders/block.properties.5xx` for Complementary v5.x.
1. Run TFG and choose the shader pack in the shaders menu.
